Amazon like-storefront application that uses a MySQL database. 

The application takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory. This is all part of the "Customer View." 

In addition to the "Customer View", there is a "Manager View" that presents the user with a menu of four different options: 

	1. View Products for Sale
	2. View Low Inventory
	3. Add to Inventory
	4. Add New Product

Each option interacts with the MySQL database. 

The tutorial video elaborating on the application can be found here, [Bamazon](https://youtu.be/50AaxNQx4tA).
